# MultiThread

Self-exploration on multi-threading and understanding how it works.

Program lets you pick anywhere from 2 to 10 threads and assigns them an id.
It proceeds to ask you the delay interval (sleep time) of each thread before executing.
When executed it prints out a statement of the time it was executed.
Once each thread executes 30 times, the program terminates.

Uses WINAPI so it is Windows specific and explores how multi-threading can work using mutex.
