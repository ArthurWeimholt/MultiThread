# MultiThread

Program lets you pick anywhere from 2 to 10 threads and assigns them an id.

It proceeds to ask you the delay interval (sleep time) of each thread before executing.
\nWhen executed it prints out a statement of the time it was executed.
\nOnce each thread executes 30 times, the program terminates.

Windows specific and explores how multithreading can work using mutex.
